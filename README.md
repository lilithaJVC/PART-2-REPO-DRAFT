<p>
Logistic Regression is a  statistical model that is used for classification problems where the outcome is binary, this means that it has only two possible results (like "Yes/No," "Popular/Not Popular," ).
as opposed to  standard Linear Regression, which predicts a continuous number, Logistic Regression predicts the probability of the event occurring (a value between 0 and 1). It achieves this by using an S-shaped sigmoid function to "squash" the linear combination of the input features into the probability range.
This model is prized for its high interpretability. Its coefficients can be directly translated into Odds Ratios, which tell us exactly how much a change in a feature (for exmample a higher book rating) increases or decreases the odds of the target outcome (efor example, becoming a best-seller).

<p>The main objective of this project is to develop as well as  evaluate a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a book will achieve "Popular" (Best-Seller) status. This classification task transforms book metadata, such as ratings, publication history, and publisher, into a reliable forecast for the publishing house.
for this task , i used a dataset of over 55,000 records. The project follows a systematic process which includes : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical Feature Selection (using VIF and P-values), and Model Training. The evaluation critically assesses performance in this imbalanced classification problem, focusing on metrics like Recall to deliver a robust and interpretable model for maximizing acquisition success.</p>
